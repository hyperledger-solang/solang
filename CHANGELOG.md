# Changelog
All notable changes to [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/)
will be documented here.

## v0.2.1 Rio

### Added
- The Anchor IDL data structure is now generated for every Solana contract, although the actual IDL json file is not yet saved.
[LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)

### Changed
- The Solana target now utilizes eight byte Anchor discriminators for function dispatch instead
of the four byte Ethereum selectors. [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- The deployment of contracts on Solana now follows the same scheme as Anchor. [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Compares between rational literals and integers are not allowed. [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Overriding the function selector value is now done using the `@selector([1, 2, 3, 4])`
  syntax, and the old syntax `selector=hex"12345678"` has been removed.
- `msg.sender` was not implemented correctly on Solana, and
  [has now been removed](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targets/solana.html#msg-sender-solana).
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Solang now uses LLVM 14. [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)

### Fixed
- Many bugs have been fixed by [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung), [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
  and [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)

## v0.2.0 Berlin
We are happy to release solang `v0.2.0` codenamed `Berlin` today. Aside from
containing many small fixes and improvements, this release marks a milestone
towards maturing our Substrate compilation target: any regressions building up
since `ink!` v3.0 are fixed, most notably the metadata format (shoutout and many
thanks to external contributor [extraymond](https://github.com/extraymond)) and
event topics. Furthermore, we are leaving `ink!` version 3 behind us, in favor
of introducing compatibility with the recent `ink!` 4 beta release and the latest
substrate contracts node `v0.22.1`.

### Added
- **Solana / breaking:** The try-catch construct is no longer permitted on Solana, as it
  never worked. Any CPI error will abort the transaction.
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- **Solana:** Introduce new sub-command `solang idl` which can be used for generating
  a Solidity interface file from an Anchor IDL file. This can be used for calling
  Anchor Contracts on Solana. [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- **Substrate:** Provide specific Substrate builtins via a "substrate" file. The
  `Hash` type from `ink!` is the first `ink!` specific type made available for Solidity
  contracts.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Introduce the `--log-api-return-codes` CLI flag, which changes the
  emitted code to print return codes for `seal` API calls into the debug buffer.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- Introduce function name mangling for overloaded functions and constructors, so
  that they can be represented properly in the metadata.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)

### Changed
- The Solana target now uses Borsh encoding rather than eth abi
  encoding. This is aimed at making Solang contracts Anchor compatible.
  [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- **Substrate / breaking:** Supported node version is now pallet contracts `v0.22.1`.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate / breaking:** Remove the deprecated `random` builtin.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)

### Fixed
- Whenever possible, the parser does not give up after the first error.
  [salaheldinsoliman](https://github.com/salaheldinsoliman)
- Constant expressions are checked for overflow.
  [salaheldinsoliman](https://github.com/salaheldinsoliman)
- AddMod and MulMod were broken. This is now fixed.
  [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- **Substrate / breaking:** Solang is now compatible with `ink!` version 4 (beta).
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Switched ABI generation to use official `ink!` crates, which fixes all
  remaining metadata regressions.
  [extraymond](https://github.com/extraymond) and [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Allow constructors to have a name, so that multiple constructors are
  supported, like in `ink!`.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- All provided examples as well as most of the Solidity code snippets in our
  documentation are now checked for succesful compilation on the Solang CI.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- **Substrate:** Fix events with topics. The topic hashes generated by Solang
  contracts are now exactly the same as those generated by `ink!`.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)

## v0.1.13 Genoa

### Changed
- Introduce sub-commands to the CLI. Now we have dedicated sub-commands for
  `compile`, `doc`, `shell-completion` and the `language-server`, which makes
  for a cleaner CLI.
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- On Solana, emitted events are encoded with Borsh encoding following the Anchor
  format.
  [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- The ewasm target has been removed, since ewasm is not going to implemented on
  Ethereum. The target has been reused for an new EVM target, which is not complete
  yet.
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Substrate: Concrete contracts must now have at least one public function. A
  public function is in a contract, if it has public or external functions, if
  it has a receive or any fallback function or if it has public storage items
  (those will yield public getters). This aligns solang up with `ink!`.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)

### Added
- Solana v1.11 is now supported.
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- On Solana, programs now use a custom heap implementation, just like on
  Substrate. As result, it is now possible to `.push()` and `.pop()` on
  dynamic arrays in memory.
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Arithmetic overflow tests are implemented for all integer widths,
  [salaheldinsoliman](https://github.com/salaheldinsoliman)
- Add an NFT example for Solana
  [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- Add a wrapper for the Solana System Program
  [LucasSte](https://github.com/LucasSte)
- The selector for functions can be overriden with the `selector=hex"abcd0123"`
  syntax.
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Shell completion is available using the `solang shell-completion` subcommand.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
- Add support for the `create_program_address()` and `try_find_program_address()`
  system call on Solana
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Substrate: The `print()` builtin is now supported and will write to the debug
  buffer. Additionally, error messages from the `require` statements will now be
  written to the debug buffer as well. The Substrate contracts pallet prints the
  contents of the debug buffer to the console for RPC ("dry-run") calls in case
  the `runtime::contracts=debug` log level is configured.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)

### Fixed
- DocComments `/** ... */` are now permitted anywhere.
  [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Function calls to contract functions via contract name are no longer possible,
  except for functions of base contracts.
  [xermicus](https://github.com/xermicus)
