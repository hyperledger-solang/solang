Visual Studio Code Extension
============================

Solang has
`language server <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol>`_ built
into the executable, which can be used by the Visual Studio Code extension. This
extension provides the following:

1. Syntax highlighting
2. Compiler warnings and errors are displayed in the problems tab and marked
   with squiqqly lines, this is also known as `diagnostics`.
3. Hovering over variables, types, functions etc and more will give information,
   For example this will give the struct fields when hovering over a variable
   which is a reference to a struct.

Both the Visual Studio Code extension code and the language server were developed under a
`Hyperledger Mentorship programme <https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Create+a+new+Solidity+Language+Server+%28SLS%29+using+Solang+Compiler>`_.

Using the extension
-------------------

The extension can be found on the `Visual Studio Marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=solang.solang>`_.

On first start, the extension will ask to download the Solang binary. Once this is done, it should just automatically work.
However, you should set the blockchain target in the extension settings. The Solidity language differs in subtle ways depending on which target you are
building for. Different blockchains offer different builtins, for example. See the :ref:`builtins documentation <builtins>` for more information.

Development
-----------

The code is spread over two parts. The first part the vscode extension client code,
`written in TypeScript <https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/tree/main/vscode>`_.
This part deals with syntax highlighting, and calling out to the Solang language server when
needed. The client needs `npm and node installed <https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>`_.
The client implementation is present in
`src/client <https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/tree/main/vscode/src/client>`_.
The extension client code is in
`src/client/extension.ts <https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/tree/main/vscode/src/client/extension.ts>`_.

Secondly, there is the language server which is written in Rust.
The Solang binary has an option ``--language-server``, which start the
`built-in language server <https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/blob/main/src/bin/languageserver/mod.rs>`_.

Once you have node and npm installed, you can build the extension like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/solang
    cd solang/vscode
    npm install
    npm install -g vsce
    vsce package

You should now have an extension file called solang-0.3.0.vsix which can be
installed using `code --install-extension solang-0.3.0.vsix`.

Alternatively, the extension be run from vscode itself.

1. Inside a vscode instance, Ctrl+Shift+B to build the project
2. On the task bar at the bottom of the IDE select Launch Client
3. Open a Solidity file (.sol) to test the extension.

To run the tests:

1. Inside a vscode instance, Ctrl+Shift+B to build the project
2. On the task bar at the bottom of the IDE select Extensions tests
3. The result should be displayed in the debug console of the host IDE instance.
