Solidity Language
=================

The Solidity language supported by Solang aims to be compatible with the latest
`Ethereum Foundation Solidity Compiler <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/>`_,
version 0.7 with some caveats.

.. note::

  Where differences exist between different targets or the Ethereum Foundation Solidity
  compiler, this is noted in boxes like these.

Brief Language Status
---------------------

As with any new project, bugs are possible. Please report any issues you may find to github.

Differences:

- libraries are always statically linked into the contract code
- Solang generates WebAssembly or BPF rather than EVM. This means that the ``assembly {}``
  statement using EVM instructions is not supported

Unique features to Solang:

- Solang can target different blockchains and some features depending on the target.
  For example, Parity Substrate uses a different ABI encoding and allows constructors
  to be overloaded.
- Events can be declared outside of contracts
- Base contracts can be declared in any order
- There is a ``print()`` function for debugging
- Strings can be formatted with python style format string, which is useful for debugging: ``print("x = {}".format(x));``

Solidity Source File Structure
------------------------------

A single Solidity source file may define multiple contracts. A contract is defined
with the ``contract`` keyword, following by the contract name and then the definition
of the contract in between curly braces ``{`` and ``}``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract A {
        /// foo simply returns true
        function foo() public returns (bool) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    contract B {
        /// bar simply returns false
        function bar() public returns (bool) {
            return false;
        }
    }

When compiling this, Solang will output contract code for both `A` and `B`, irrespective of
the name of source file. Although multiple contracts maybe defined in one solidity source
file, it might be convenient to define a single contract in each file with the same name
as the file name.

Imports
_______

The ``import`` directive is used to import from other Solidity files. This can be useful to
keep a single definition in one file, which can be used in multiple other files. Solidity imports
are somewhat similar to JavaScript ES6, however there is no export statement, or default export.

The following can be imported:

- global constants
- struct definitions
- enums definitions
- event definitions
- global functions
- contracts, including abstract contract, libraries, and interfaces

There are a few different flavours of import. You can specify if you want everything imported,
or a just a select few. You can also rename the imports. The following directive imports only
`foo` and `bar`:

.. code-block:: javascript

    import {foo, bar} from "defines.sol";

Solang will look for the file `defines.sol` in the same directory as the current file. You can specify
more directories to search with the ``--importpath`` commandline option.
Just like with ES6, ``import`` is hoisted to the top and both `foo` and `bar` are usuable
even before the ``import`` statement. It is also possible to import everything from
`defines.sol` by leaving the list out. Note that this is different than ES6, which would import nothing
with this syntax.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import "defines.sol";

Everything defined in `defines.sol` is now usable in your Solidity file. However, if something with the
same name is defined in `defines.sol` and also in the current file, you will get a warning. Note that
that it is legal to import the same file more than once.

It is also possible to rename an import. In this case, only type `foo` will be imported, and `bar`
will be imported as `baz`. This is useful if you have already have a `bar` and you want to avoid
a naming conflict.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import {bar as baz,foo} from "defines.sol";

Rather than renaming individual imports, it is also possible to make all the types in a file
available under a special import object. In this case, the `bar` defined in `defines.sol` can is
now visible as `defs.bar`, and `foo` is `defs.foo`. As long as there is no previous type `defs`,
there can be no naming conflict.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import "defines.sol" as defs;

This also has a slightly more baroque syntax, which does exactly the same.

.. code-block:: javascript

    import * as defs from "defines.sol";


Pragmas
_______

A pragma value is a special directive to the compiler. It has a name, and a value. The name
is an identifier and the value is any text terminated by a semicolon `;`. Solang parses
pragmas but does not recognise any.

Often, Solidity source files start with a ``pragma solidity`` which specifies the Ethereum
Foundation Solidity compiler version which is permitted to compile this code. Solang does
not follow the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler version numbering scheme, so these
pragma statements are silently ignored. There is no need for a ``pragma solidity`` statement
when using Solang.

.. code-block:: javascript

    pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;
    pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

The `ABIEncoderV2` pragma is not needed with Solang; structures can always be ABI encoded or
decoded. All other pragma statements are ignored, but generate warnings.

Types
-----

The following primitive types are supported.

Boolean Type
____________

``bool``
  This represents a single value which can be either ``true`` or ``false``.

Integer Types
_____________

``uint``
  This represents a single unsigned integer of 256 bits wide. Values can be for example
  ``0``, ``102``, ``0xdeadcafe``, or ``1000_000_000_000_000``.

``uint64``, ``uint32``, ``uint16``, ``uint8``
  These represent shorter single unsigned integers of the given width. These widths are
  most efficient and should be used whenever possible.

``uintN``
  These represent shorter single unsigned integers of width ``N``. ``N`` can be anything
  between 8 and 256 bits and a multiple of 8, e.g. ``uint24``.

``int``
  This represents a single signed integer of 256 bits wide. Values can be for example
  ``-102``, ``0``, ``102`` or ``-0xdead_cafe``.

``int64``, ``int32``, ``int16``, ``int8``
  These represent shorter single signed integers of the given width. These widths are
  most efficient and should be used whenever possible.

``intN``
  These represent shorter single signed integers of width ``N``. ``N`` can be anything
  between 8 and 256 bits and a multiple of 8, e.g. ``int128``.

Underscores ``_`` are allowed in numbers, as long as the number does not start with
an underscore.  ``1_000`` is allowed but ``_1000`` is not. Similarly
``0xffff_0000`` is fine, but ``0x_f`` is not.

Scientific notation is supported, e.g. ``1e6`` is one million. Only integer values
are supported.

Assigning values which cannot fit into the type gives a compiler error. For example::

    uint8 foo = 300;

The largest value an ``uint8`` can hold is (2 :superscript:`8`) - 1 = 255. So, the compiler says:

.. code-block:: none

    literal 300 is too large to fit into type ‘uint8’

.. tip::

  When using integers, whenever possible use the ``int64``, ``int32`` or ``uint64``,
  ``uint32`` types.

  The Solidity language has its origins for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which has
  support for 256 bit arithmetic. Most common CPUs like x86_64 do not implement arithmetic
  for such large types, and any EVM virtual machine implementation has to do bigint
  calculations, which are expensive.

  WebAssembly or BPF do not support this. As a result that Solang has to emulate larger types with
  many instructions, resulting in larger contract code and higher gas cost.

Fixed Length byte arrays
________________________

Solidity has a primitive type unique to the language. It is a fixed-length byte array of 1 to 32
bytes, declared with *bytes* followed by the array length, for example:
``bytes32``, ``bytes24``, ``bytes8``, or ``bytes1``. ``byte`` is an alias for ``byte1``, so
``byte`` is an array of 1 element. The arrays can be initialized with either a hex string or
a text string.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes4 foo = "ABCD";
  bytes4 bar = hex"41_42_43_44";

The ascii value for ``A`` is 41 in hexadecimal. So, in this case, foo and bar
are initialized to the same value. Underscores are allowed in hex strings; they exist for
readability. If the string is shorter than the type, it is padded with zeros. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes6 foo = "AB" "CD";
  bytes5 bar = hex"41";

String literals can be concatenated like they can in C or C++. Here the types are longer than
the initializers; this means they are padded at the end with zeros. foo will contain the following
bytes in hexadecimal ``41 42 43 44 00 00`` and bar will be ``41 00 00 00 00``.

These types can be used with all the bitwise operators, ``~``, ``|``, ``&``, ``^``, ``<<``, and
``>>``. When these operators are used, the type behaves like an unsigned integer type. In this case
think the type not as an array but as a long number. For example, it is possible to shift by one bit:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes2 foo = hex"0101" << 1;
  // foo is 02 02

Since this is an array type, it is possible to read array elements too. They are indexed from zero.
It is not permitted to set array elements; the value of a bytesN type can only be changed
by setting the entire array value.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes6 wake_code = "heotymeo";
  bytes1 second_letter = wake_code[1]; // second_letter is "e"

The length can be read using the ``.length`` member variable. Since this is a fixed size array, this
is always the length of the type itself.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes32 hash;
  assert(hash.length == 32);
  byte b;
  assert(b.length == 1);

Address and Address Payable Type
________________________________

The ``address`` type holds the address of an account. The length of an ``address`` type depends on
the target being compiled for. On ewasm, an address is 20 bytes. Substrate has an address length
of 32 bytes. The format of an address literal depends on what target you are building for. On ewasm,
ethereum addresses can be specified with a particular hexadecimal number.

.. code-block:: javascript

  address foo = 0xE9430d8C01C4E4Bb33E44fd7748942085D82fC91;

The hexadecimal string has to have 40 characters, and not contain any underscores.
The capitalization, i.e. whether ``a`` to ``f`` values are capitalized, is important.
It is defined in
`EIP-55 <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md>`_. For example,
when compiling:

.. code-block:: javascript

  address foo = 0xe9430d8C01C4E4Bb33E44fd7748942085D82fC91;

Since the hexadecimal string is 40 characters without underscores, and the string does
not match the EIP-55 encoding, the compiler will refused to compile this. To make this
a regular hexadecimal number, not an address literal, add some leading zeros or some underscores.
In order to fix the address literal, copy the address literal from the compiler error message:

.. code-block:: none

  error: address literal has incorrect checksum, expected ‘0xE9430d8C01C4E4Bb33E44fd7748942085D82fC91’

Substrate or Solana addresses are base58 encoded, not hexadecimal. An address literal can be specified with
the special syntax ``address"<account>"``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    address foo = address"5GBWmgdFAMqm8ZgAHGobqDqX6tjLxJhv53ygjNtaaAn3sjeZ";

An address can be payable or not. An payable address can used with the
:ref:`.send() and .transfer() functions <send_transfer>`, and
:ref:`selfdestruct` function. A non-payable address or contract can be cast to an ``address payable``
using the ``payable()`` cast, like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

    address payable addr = payable(this);

``address`` cannot be used in any arithmetic or bitwise operations. However, it can be cast to and from
bytes types and integer types. The ``==`` and ``!=`` operators work for comparing two address types.

.. code-block:: javascript

  address foo = address(0);

.. note::
    The type name ``address payable`` cannot be used as a cast in the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler,
    and the cast must be ``payable`` instead. This is
    `apparently due to a limitation in their parser <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4926#discussion_r216586365>`_.
    Solang's generated parser has no such limitation and allows ``address payable`` to be used as a cast,
    but allows ``payable`` to be used as a cast well, for compatibility reasons.

.. note::

    Substrate can be compiled with a different type for Address. If you need support for
    a different length than the default, please get in touch.

Enums
_____

Solidity enums types need to have a definition which lists the possible values it can hold. An enum
has a type name, and a list of unique values. Enum types can used in public functions, but the value
is represented as a ``uint8`` in the ABI.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract enum_example {
      enum Weekday { Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday }

      function is_weekend(Weekday day) public pure returns (bool) {
          return (day == Weekday.Saturday || day == Weekday.Sunday);
      }
  }

An enum can be converted to and from integer, but this requires an explicit cast. The value of an enum
is numbered from 0, like in C and Rust.

If enum is declared in another contract, the type can be refered to with `contractname.typename`. The
individual enum values are `contractname.typename.value`. The enum declaration does not have to appear
in a contract, in which case it can be used without the contract name prefix.

.. code-block:: javascript

    enum planets { Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune }

    contract timeofday {
        enum time { Night, Day, Dawn, Dusk }
    }

    contract stargazing {
        function look_for(timeofday.time when) public returns (planets[]) {
            if (when == timeofday.time.Dawn || when == timeofday.time.Dusk) {
                planets[] x = new planets[](2);
                x[0] = planets.Mercury;
                x[1] = planets.Venus;
                return x;
            } else if (when == timeofday.time.Night) {
                planets[] x = new planets[](5);
                x[0] = planets.Mars;
                x[1] = planets.Jupiter;
                x[2] = planets.Saturn;
                x[3] = planets.Uranus;
                x[4] = planets.Neptune;
                return x;
            } else {
                planets[] x = new planets[](1);
                x[0] = planets.Earth;
                return x;
            }
        }
    }

Struct Type
___________

A struct is composite type of several other types. This is used to group related items together.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract deck {
      enum suit { club, diamonds, hearts, spades }
      enum value { two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace }
      struct card {
          value v;
          suit s;
      }

      function score(card c) public returns (uint32 score) {
          if (c.s == suit.hearts) {
              if (c.v == value.ace) {
                  score = 14;
              }
              if (c.v == value.king) {
                  score = 13;
              }
              if (c.v == value.queen) {
                  score = 12;
              }
              if (c.v == value.jack) {
                  score = 11;
              }
          }
          // all others score 0
      }
  }

A struct has one or more fields, each with a unique name. Structs can be function arguments and return
values. Structs can contain other structs. There is a struct literal syntax to create a struct with
all the fields set.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract deck {
      enum suit { club, diamonds, hearts, spades }
      enum value { two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace }
      struct card {
          value v;
          suit s;
      }

      card card1 = card(value.two, suit.club);
      card card2 = card({s: suit.club, v: value.two});

      // This function does a lot of copying
      function set_card1(card c) public returns (card previous) {
          previous = card1;
          card1 = c;
      }
  }

The two contract storage variables ``card1`` and ``card2`` have initializers using struct literals. Struct
literals can either set fields by their position, or field name. In either syntax, all the fields must
be specified. When specifying structs fields by position, the order of the fields must match with the
struct definition. When fields are specified by name, the order is not important.

Struct definitions from other contracts can be used, by referring to them with the `contractname.`
prefix. Struct definitions can appear outside of contract definitions, in which case they can be used
in any contract without the prefix.

.. code-block:: javascript

    struct user {
        string name;
        bool active;
    }

    contract auth {
        function authenticate(string name, db.users storage users) public returns (bool) {
            // ...
        }
    }

    contract db {
        struct users {
            user[] field1;
            int32 count;
        }
    }

The `users` struct contains an array of `user`, which is another struct. The `users` struct is
defined in contract `db`, and can be used in another contract with the type name `db.users`. Astute
readers may have noticed that the `db.users` struct is used before it is declared. In Solidity,
types can be always be used before their declaration, or before they are imported.

Structs can be contract storage variables. Structs in contract storage can be assigned to structs
in memory and vice versa, like in the *set_card1()* function. Copying structs between storage
and memory is expensive; code has to be generated for each field and executed.

- The function argument ``c`` has to ABI decoded (1 copy + decoding overhead)
- The ``card1`` has to load from contract storage (1 copy + contract storage overhead)
- The ``c`` has to be stored into contract storage (1 copy + contract storage overhead)
- The ``previous`` struct has to ABI encoded (1 copy + encoding overhead)

Note that struct variables are references. When contract struct variables or normal struct variables
are passed around, just the memory address or storage slot is passed around internally. This makes
it very cheap, but it does mean that if a called function modifies the struct, then this is
visible in the caller as well.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract foo {
      struct bar {
          bytes32 f1;
          bytes32 f2;
          bytes32 f3;
          bytes32 f4;
      }

      function f(bar b) public {
          b.f4 = "foobar";
      }

      function example() public {
          bar bar1;

          // bar1 is passed by reference; just its pointer is passed
          f(bar1);

          assert(bar1.f4 == "foobar");
      }
  }

.. note::

  In the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler, you need to add ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;``
  to use structs as return values or function arguments in public functions. The default ABI encoder
  of Solang can handle structs, so there is no need for this pragma. The Solang compiler ignores
  this pragma if present.

Fixed Length Arrays
___________________

Arrays can be declared by adding [length] to the type name, where length is a
constant expression. Any type can be made into an array, including arrays themselves (also
known as arrays of arrays). For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        /// In a vote with 11 voters, do the ayes have it?
        function f(bool[11] votes) public pure returns (bool) {
            uint32 i;
            uint32 ayes = 0;

            for (i=0; i<votes.length; i++) {
                if (votes[i]) {
                    ayes += 1;
                }
            }

            // votes.length is odd; integer truncation means that 11 / 2 = 5
            return ayes > votes.length / 2;
        }
    }

Note the length of the array can be read with the ``.length`` member. The length is readonly.
Arrays can be initialized with an array literal. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract primes {
        function primenumber(uint32 n) public pure returns (uint64) {
            uint64[10] primes = [ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 ];

            return primes[n];
        }
    }

Any array subscript which is out of bounds (either an negative array index, or an index past the
last element) will cause a runtime exception. In this example, calling ``primenumber(10)`` will
fail; the first prime number is indexed by 0, and the last by 9.

Arrays are passed by reference. If you modify the array in another function, those changes will
be reflected in the current function. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract reference {
        function set_2(int8[4] a) pure private {
            a[2] = 102;
        }

        function foo() private {
            int8[4] val = [ int8(1), 2, 3, 4 ];

            set_2(val);

            // val was passed by reference, so was modified
            assert(val[2] == 102);
        }
    }

.. note::

  In Solidity, an fixed array of 32 bytes (or smaller) can be declared as ``bytes32`` or
  ``uint8[32]``. In the Ethereum ABI encoding, an ``int8[32]`` is encoded using
  32 × 32 = 1024 bytes. This is because the Ethereum ABI encoding pads each primitive to
  32 bytes. However, since ``bytes32`` is a primitive in itself, this will only be 32
  bytes when ABI encoded.

  In Substrate, the `SCALE <https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/codec>`_
  encoding uses 32 bytes for both types.

Dynamic Length Arrays
_____________________

Dynamic length arrays are useful for when you do not know in advance how long your arrays
will need to be. They are declared by adding ``[]`` to your type. How they can be used depends
on whether they are contract storage variables or stored in memory.

Memory dynamic arrays must be allocated with ``new`` before they can be used. The ``new``
expression requires a single unsigned integer argument. The length can be read using
``length`` member variable. Once created, the length of the array cannot be changed.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract dynamicarray {
        function test(uint32 size) public {
            int64[] memory a = new int64[](size);

            for (uint32 i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                a[i] = 1 << i;
            }

            assert(a.length == size);
        }
    }


.. note::

    There is experimental support for `push()` and `pop()` on memory arrays.

Storage dynamic memory arrays do not have to be allocated. By default, they have a
length of zero and elements can be added and removed using the ``push()`` and ``pop()``
methods.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract s {
        int64[] a;

        function test() public {
            // push takes a single argument with the item to be added
            a.push(128);
            // push with no arguments adds 0
            a.push();
            // now we have two elements in our array, 128 and 0
            assert(a.length == 2);
            a[0] |= 64;
            // pop removes the last element
            a.pop();
            // you can assign the return value of pop
            int64 v = a.pop();
            assert(v == 192);
        }
    }

Calling the method ``pop()`` on an empty array is an error and contract execution will abort,
just like when you access an element beyond the end of an array.

``push()`` without any arguments returns a storage reference. This is only available for types
that support storage references (see below).

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        struct user {
            address who;
            uint32 hitcount;
        }
        s[] foo;

        function test() public {
            // foo.push() creates an empty entry and returns a reference to it
            user storage x = foo.push();

            x.who = address(1);
            x.hitcount = 1;
        }
    }

Depending on the array element, ``pop()`` can be costly. It has to first copy the element to
memory, and then clear storage.

String
______

Strings can be initialized with a string literal or a hex literal. Strings can be concatenated and
compared, and formatted using `.format()`; no other operations are allowed on strings.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        function test1(string s) public returns (bool) {
            string str = "Hello, " + s + "!";

            return (str == "Hello, World!");
        }

        function test2(string s, int64 n) public returns (string res) {
            res = "Hello, {}! #{}".format(s, n);
        }
    }

Strings can be cast to `bytes`. This cast has no runtime cost, since both types use
the same underlying data structure.

.. note::

    The Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler does not allow unicode characters in string literals,
    unless it is prefixed with unicode, e.g. ``unicode"€"`` . For compatibility, Solang also
    accepts the unicode prefix. Solang always allows unicode characters in strings.

Dynamic Length Bytes
____________________

The ``bytes`` datatype is a dynamic length array of bytes. It can be created with
the ``new`` operator, or from an string or hex initializer. Unlike the ``string`` type,
it is possible to index the ``bytes`` datatype like an array.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract b {
        function test() public {
            bytes a = hex"0000_00fa";
            bytes b = new bytes(4);

            b[3] = hex"fa";

            assert(a == b);
        }
    }

If the ``bytes`` variable is a storage variable, there is a ``push()`` and ``pop()``
method available to add and remove bytes from the array. Array elements in a
memory ``bytes`` can be modified, but no elements can be removed or added, in other
words, ``push()`` and ``pop()`` are not available when ``bytes`` is stored in memory.

A ``string`` type can be cast to ``bytes``. This way, the string can be modified or
characters can be read. Note this will access the string by byte, not character, so
any non-ascii characters will need special handling.

An dynamic array of bytes can use the type ``bytes`` or ``byte[]``. The latter
stores each byte in an individual storage slot, while the former stores the
entire string in a single storage slot, when possible. Additionally a ``string``
can be cast to ``bytes`` but not to ``byte[]``.

Mappings
________

Mappings are a dictionary type, or associative arrays. Mappings have a number of
limitations:

- it has to be in contract storage, not memory
- they are not iterable
- the key cannot be a ``struct``, array, or another mapping.

Mappings are declared with ``mapping(keytype => valuetype)``, for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract b {
        struct user {
            bool exists;
            address addr;
        }
        mapping(string => user) users;

        function add(string name, address addr) public {
            // assigning to a storage variable creates a reference
            user storage s = users[name];

            s.exists = true;
            s.addr = addr;
        }

        function get(string name) public view returns (bool, address) {
            // assigning to a memory variable creates a copy
            user s = users[name];

            return (s.exists, s.addr);
        }

        function rm(string name) public {
            delete users[name];
        }
    }

.. tip::

  When assigning multiple members in a struct in a mapping, it is better to create
  a storage variable as a reference to the struct, and then assign to the reference.
  The add() function above could have been written as:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    function add(string name, address addr) public {
        s[name].exists = true;
        s[name].addr = addr;
    }

  Here the storage slot for struct is calculated twice, which includes an expensive
  keccak256 calculation.

If you access a non-existing field on a mapping, all the fields will read as zero. So, it
is common practise to have a boolean field called ``exists``. Since mappings are not iterable,
it is not possible to do a ``delete`` on an mapping, but an entry can be deleted.

.. note::

  Solidity takes the keccak 256 hash of the key and the storage slot, and simply uses that
  to find the entry. There are no hash collision chains. This scheme is simple and avoids
  `"hash flooding" <https://www.securityweek.com/hash-table-collision-attacks-could-trigger-ddos-massive-scale>`_
  attacks where the attacker chooses data which hashes to the same hash
  collision chain, making the hash table very slow; it will behave like a linked list.

  In order to implement mappings in memory, a new scheme must be found which avoids this
  attack. Usually this is done with `SipHash <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash>`_, but
  this cannot be used in smart contracts since there is no place to store secrets. Collision
  chains are needed since memory has a much smaller address space than the 256 bit storage
  slots.

  Any suggestions for solving this are very welcome!

Contract Types
______________

In Solidity, other smart contracts can be called and created. So, there is a type to hold the
address of a contract. This is in fact simply the address of the contract, with some syntax
sugar for calling functions it.

A contract can be created with the new statement, followed by the name of the contract. The
arguments to the constructor must be provided.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract child {
        function announce() public {
            print("Greetings from child contract");
        }
    }

    contract creator {
        function test() public {
            child c = new child();

            c.announce();
        }
    }

Since child does not have a constructor, no arguments are needed for the new statement. The variable
`c` of the contract `child` type, which simply holds its address. Functions can be called on
this type. The contract type can be cast to and from address, provided an explicit cast is used.

The expression ``this`` evaluates to the current contract, which can be cast to ``address`` or
``address payable``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        function get_address() public returns (address) {
            return address(this);
        }
    }

Function Types
______________

Function types are references to functions. You can use function types to pass functions
for callbacks, for example. Function types come in two flavours, ``internal`` and ``external``.
An internal function is a reference to a function in the same contract or one of its base contracts.
An external function is a reference to a public or external function on any contract.

When declaring a function type, you must specify the parameters types, return types, mutability,
and whether it is external or internal. The parameters or return types cannot have names.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract ft {
        function test() public {
            // reference to an internal function with two argments, returning bool
            // with the default mutability (i.e. cannot be payable)
            function(int32, bool) internal returns (bool) x;

            // the local function func1 can be assigned to this type; mutability
            // can be more restrictive than the type.
            x = func1;

            // now you can call func1 via the x
            bool res = x(102, false);

            // reference to an internal function with no return values, must be pure
            function(int32 arg1, bool arg2) internal pure y;

            // Does not compile: wrong number of return types and mutability
            // is not compatible.
            y = func1;
        }

        function func1(int32 arg, bool arg2) view internal returns (bool) {
            return false;
        }
    }

If the ``internal`` or ``external`` keyword is omitted, the type defaults to internal.

Just like any other type, a function type can be a function argument, function return type, or a
contract storage variable. Internal function types cannot be used in public functions parameters or
return types.

An external function type is a reference to a function in a particular contract. It stores the address of
the contract, and the function selector. An internal function type only stores the function reference. When
assigning a value to an external function selector, the contract and function must be specified, by using
a function on particular contract instance.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract ft {
        function test(paffling p) public {
            // this.callback can be used as an external function type value
            p.set_callback(this.callback);
        }

        function callback(int32 count, string foo) public {
            // ...
        }
    }

    contract paffling {
        // the first visibility "external" is for the function type, the second "internal" is
        // for the callback variables
        function(int32, string) external internal callback;

        function set_callback(function(int32, string) external c) public {
            callback = c;
        }

        function piffle() public {
            callback(1, "paffled");
        }
    }


Storage References
__________________

Parameters, return types, and variables can be declared storage references by adding
``storage`` after the type name. This means that the variable holds a references to a
particular contract storage variable.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract felix {
        enum Felines { None, Lynx, Felis, Puma, Catopuma };
        Felines[100] group_a;
        Felines[100] group_b;


        function count_pumas(Felines[100] storage cats) private returns (uint32)
    {
            uint32 count = 0;
            uint32 i = 0;

            for (i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
                if (cats[i] == Felines.Puma) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }

            return count;
        }

        function all_pumas() public returns (uint32) {
            Felines[100] storage ref = group_a;

            uint32 total = count_pumas(ref);

            ref = group_b;

            total += count_pumas(ref);

            return total;
        }
    }

Functions which have either storage parameter or return types cannot be public; when a function
is called via the ABI encoder/decoder, it is not possible to pass references, just values.
However it is possible to use storage reference variables in public functions, as
demonstrated in function all_pumas().

Expressions
-----------

Solidity resembles the C family of languages. Expressions can use the following operators.

Arithmetic operators
____________________

The binary operators ``-``, ``+``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``, and ``**`` are supported, and also
in the assignment form ``-=``, ``+=``, ``*=``, ``/=``, and ``%=``. There is a
unary operator ``-``.

.. code-block:: javascript

 	uint32 fahrenheit = celcius * 9 / 5 + 32;

Parentheses can be used too, of course:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	uint32 celcius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

Operators can also come in the assignment form.

.. code-block:: javascript

 	balance += 10;

The exponation (or power) can be used to multiply a number N times by itself, i.e.
x :superscript:`y`. This can only be done for unsigned types.

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 thousand = 1000;
  uint64 billion = thousand ** 3;

Overflow checking is limited to types of 64 bits and smaller, if the `--math-overflow` command
line argument is specified. No overflow checking is generated in `unchecked` blocks, like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function f(int64 n) public {
            unchecked {
                int64 j = n - 1;
            }
        }
    }

.. warning::

  Overflow checking for types larger than ``int64`` (e.g. ``uint128``) is not implemented yet.

Bitwise operators
_________________

The ``|``, ``&``, ``^`` are supported, as are the shift operators ``<<``
and ``>>``. These are also available in the assignment form ``|=``, ``&=``,
``^=``, ``<<=``, and ``>>=``. Lastly there is a unary operator ``~`` to
invert all the bits in a value.

Logical operators
_________________

The logical operators ``||``, ``&&``, and ``!`` are supported. The ``||`` and ``&&``
short-circuit. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bool foo = x > 0 || bar();

bar() will not be called if the left hand expression evaluates to true, i.e. x is greater
than 0. If x is 0, then bar() will be called and the result of the ``||`` will be
the return value of bar(). Similarly, the right hand expressions of ``&&`` will not be
evaluated if the left hand expression evaluates to ``false``; in this case, whatever
ever the outcome of the right hand expression, the ``&&`` will result in ``false``.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bool foo = x > 0 && bar();

Now ``bar()`` will only be called if x *is* greater than 0. If x is 0 then the ``&&``
will result in false, irrespective of what bar() would return, so bar() is not
called at all. The expression elides execution of the right hand side, which is also
called *short-circuit*.


Conditional operator
____________________

The ternary conditional operator ``? :`` is supported:

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 abs = foo > 0 ? foo : -foo;


Comparison operators
____________________

It is also possible to compare values. For, this the ``>=``, ``>``, ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, and ``<=``
is supported. This is useful for conditionals.


The result of a comparison operator can be assigned to a bool. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

 	bool even = (value % 2) == 0;

It is not allowed to assign an integer to a bool; an explicit comparision is needed to turn it into
a bool.

Increment and Decrement operators
_________________________________

The post-increment and pre-increment operators are implemented like you would expect. So, ``a++``
evaluates to the value of ``a`` before incrementing, and ``++a`` evaluates to value of ``a``
after incrementing.

this
____

The keyword ``this`` evaluates to the current contract. The type of this is the type of the
current contract. It can be cast to ``address`` or ``address payable`` using a cast.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract kadowari {
        function nomi() public {
            kadowari c = this;
            address a = address(this);
        }
    }

Function calls made via this are function calls through the external call mechanism; i.e. they
have to serialize and deserialise the arguments and have the external call overhead. In addition,
this only works with public functions.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract kadowari {
        function nomi() public {
            this.nokogiri(102);
        }

        function nokogiri(int a) public {
            // ...
        }
    }

type(..) operators
__________________

For integer values, the minimum and maximum values the types can hold are available using the
``type(...).min`` and ``type(...).max`` operators. For unsigned integers, ``type(..).min``
will always be 0.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        int16 stored;

        function func(int x) public {
            if (x < type(int16).min || x > type(int16).max) {
                revert("value will not fit");
            }

            stored = int16(x);
        }
    }

The `EIP-165 <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165>`_ interface value can be retrieved using the
syntax ``type(...).interfaceId``. This is only permitted on interfaces. The interfaceId is simply
an bitwise XOR of all function selectors in the interface. This makes it possible to uniquely identify
an interface at runtime, which can be used to write a `supportsInterface()` function as described
in the EIP.

The contract code for a contract, i.e. the binary WebAssembly or BPF, can be retrieved using the
``type(c).creationCode`` and ``type(c).runtimeCode`` fields, as ``bytes``. In Ethereum,
the constructor code is in the ``creationCode`` WebAssembly and all the functions are in
the ``runtimeCode`` WebAssembly or BPF. Parity Substrate has a single WebAssembly code for both,
so both fields will evaluate to the same value.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        function test() public {
            bytes runtime = type(other).runtimeCode;
        }
    }

    contract other {
        bool foo;
    }

.. note::
    ``type().creationCode`` and ``type().runtimeCode`` are compile time constants.

    It is not possible to access the code for the current contract. If this were possible,
    then the contract code would need to contain itself as a constant array, which would
    result in an contract of infinite size.

Ether and time units
____________________

Any decimal numeric literal constant can have a unit denomination. For example
``10 minutes`` will evaluate to 600, i.e. the constant will be multiplied by the
multiplier listed below. The following units are available:

=========== =========================
Unit        Multiplier

``seconds`` 1
``minutes`` 60
``hours``   3600
``days``    86400
``weeks``   604800
``wei``     1
``szabo``   1_000_000_000_000
``finney``  1_000_000_000_000_000
``ether``   1_000_000_000_000_000_000
=========== =========================

Note that ``ether``, ``wei`` and the other Ethereum currency denominations are available when not
compiling for Ethereum, but they will produce warnings.

Casting
_______

Solidity is very strict about the sign of operations, and whether an assignment can truncate a
value. You can force the compiler to accept truncations or differences in sign by adding a cast.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function abs(int bar) public returns (int64) {
      if (bar > 0) {
          return bar;
      } else {
          return -bar;
      }
  }

The compiler will say:

.. code-block:: none

   implicit conversion would truncate from int256 to int64

Now you can work around this by adding a cast to the argument to return ``return int64(bar);``,
however it would be much nicer if the return value matched the argument. Instead, implement
multiple overloaded abs() functions, so that there is an ``abs()`` for each type.

It is allowed to cast from a ``bytes`` type to ``int`` or ``uint`` (or vice versa), only if the length
of the type is the same. This requires an explicit cast.

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes4 selector = "ABCD";
  uint32 selector_as_uint = uint32(selector);

If the length also needs to change, then another cast is needed to adjust the length. Truncation and
extension is different for integers and bytes types. Integers pad zeros on the left when extending,
and truncate on the right. bytes pad on right when extending, and truncate on the left. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

  bytes4 start = "ABCD";
  uint64 start1 = uint64(uint4(start));
  // first cast to int, then extend as int: start1 = 0x41424344
  uint64 start2 = uint64(bytes8(start));
  // first extend as bytes, then cast to int: start2 = 0x4142434400000000

A similar example for truncation:

.. code-block:: javascript

  uint64 start = 0xdead_cafe;
  bytes4 start1 = bytes4(uint32(start));
  // first truncate as int, then cast: start1 = hex"cafe"
  bytes4 start2 = bytes4(bytes8(start));
  // first cast, then truncate as bytes: start2 = hex"dead"

Since ``byte`` is array of one byte, a conversion from ``byte`` to ``uint8`` requires a cast.

Statements
----------

In functions, you can declare variables in code blocks. If the name is the same as
an existing function, enum type, or another variable, then the compiler will generate a
warning as the original item is no longer accessible.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract test {
      uint foo = 102;
      uint bar;

      function foobar() private {
          // AVOID: this shadows the contract storage variable foo
          uint foo = 5;
      }
  }

Scoping rules apply as you would expect, so if you declare a variable in a block, then it is not
accessible outside that block. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   function foo() public {
      // new block is introduced with { and ends with }
      {
          uint a;

          a = 102;
      }

      // ERROR: a is out of scope
      uint b = a + 5;
  }

If statement
____________

Conditional execution of a block can be achieved using an ``if (condition) { }`` statement. The
condition must evaluate to a ``bool`` value.

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint32 n) private {
      if (n > 10) {
          // do something
      }

      // ERROR: unlike C integers can not be used as a condition
      if (n) {
            // ...
      }
  }

The statements enclosed by ``{`` and ``}`` (commonly known as a *block*) are executed only if
the condition evaluates to true.

While statement
_______________

Repeated execution of a block can be achieved using ``while``. It syntax is similar to ``if``,
however the block is repeatedly executed until the condition evaluates to false.
If the condition is not true on first execution, then the loop is never executed:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      while (n >= 10) {
          n -= 9;
      }
  }

It is possible to terminate execution of the while statement by using the ``break`` statement.
Execution will continue to next statement in the function. Alternatively, ``continue`` will
cease execution of the block, but repeat the loop if the condition still holds:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      while (n >= 10) {
          n--;

          if (n >= 100) {
              // do not execute the if statement below, but loop again
              continue;
          }

          if (bar(n)) {
              // cease execution of this while loop and jump to the "n = 102" statement
              break;
          }
      }

      n = 102;
  }

Do While statement
__________________

A ``do { ... } while (condition);`` statement is much like the ``while (condition) { ... }`` except
that the condition is evaluated after execution the block. This means that the block is executed
at least once, which is not true for ``while`` statements:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      do {
          n--;

          if (n >= 100) {
              // do not execute the if statement below, but loop again
              continue;
          }

          if (bar(n)) {
              // cease execution of this while loop and jump to the "n = 102" statement
              break;
          }
      }
      while (n > 10);

      n = 102;
  }

For statements
______________

For loops are like ``while`` loops with added syntaxic sugar. To execute a loop, we often
need to declare a loop variable, set its initial variable, have a loop condition, and then
adjust the loop variable for the next loop iteration.

For example, to loop from 0 to 1000 by steps of 100:

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo() private {
      for (uint i = 0; i <= 1000; i += 100) {
          // ...
      }
  }

The declaration ``uint i = 0`` can be omitted if no new variable needs to be declared, and
similarly the post increment ``i += 100`` can be omitted if not necessary. The loop condition
must evaluate to a boolean, or it can be omitted completely. If it is ommited the block must
contain a ``break`` or ``return`` statement, else execution will
repeat infinitely (or until all gas is spent):

.. code-block:: javascript

  function foo(uint n) private {
      // all three omitted
      for (;;) {
          // there must be a way out
          if (n == 0) {
              break;
          }
      }
  }

.. _destructuring:

Destructuring Statement
_______________________

The destructuring statement can be used for making function calls to functions that have
multiple return values. The list can contain either:

1. The name of an existing variable. The type must match the type of the return value.
2. A new variable declaration with a type. Again, the type must match the type of the return value.
3. Empty; this return value is ignored and not accessible.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract destructure {
        function func() internal returns (bool, int32, string) {
            return (true, 5, "abcd")
        }

        function test() public {
            string s;
            (bool b, , s) = func();
        }
    }

The right hand side may also be a list of expressions. This type can be useful for swapping
values, for example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function test() public {
        (int32 a, int32 b, int32 c) = (1, 2, 3);

        (b, , a) = (a, 5, b);
    }

The right hand side of an destructure may contain the ternary conditional operator. The number
of elements in both sides of the conditional must match the left hand side of the destructure statement.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function test(bool cond) public {
        (int32 a, int32 b, int32 c) = cond ? (1, 2, 3) : (4, 5, 6)
    }


.. _try-catch:

Try Catch Statement
___________________

Sometimes execution gets reverted due to a ``revert()`` or ``require()``. These types of problems
usually cause the entire transaction to be aborted. However, it is possible to catch
some of these problems and continue execution.

This is only possible for contract instantiation through new, and external function calls.
An internal function cannot be called from a try catch statement. Not all problems can be handled,
for example, out of gas cannot be caught. The ``revert()`` and ``require()`` builtins may
be passed a reason code, which can be inspected using the ``catch Error(string)`` syntax.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract aborting {
        constructor() {
            revert("bar");
        }
    }

    contract runner {
        function test() public {
            try new aborting() returns (aborting a) {
                // new succeeded; a holds the a reference to the new contract
            }
            catch Error(string x) {
                if (x == "bar") {
                    // "bar" revert or require was executed
                }
            }
            catch (bytes raw) {
                // if no error string could decoding, we end up here with the raw data
            }
        }
    }

The same statement can be used for calling external functions. The ``returns (...)``
part must match the return types for the function. If no name is provided, that
return value is not accessible.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract aborting {
        function abort() public returns (int32, bool) {
            revert("bar");
        }
    }

    contract runner {
        function test() public {
            aborting abort = new aborting();

            try abort.abort() returns (int32 a, bool b) {
                // call succeeded; return values are in a and b
            }
            catch Error(string x) {
                if (x == "bar") {
                    // "bar" reason code was provided through revert() or require()
                }
            }
            catch (bytes raw) {
                // if no error string could decoding, we end up here with the raw data
            }
        }
    }

There is an alternate syntax which avoids the abi decoding by leaving the `catch Error(…)` out.
This might be useful when no error string is expected, and will generate shorter code.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract aborting {
        function abort() public returns (int32, bool) {
            revert("bar");
        }
    }

    contract runner {
        function test() public {
            aborting abort = new aborting();

            try new abort.abort() returns (int32 a, bool b) {
                // call succeeded; return values are in a and b
            }
            catch (bytes raw) {
                // call failed with raw error in raw
            }
        }
    }


Functions
---------

A function can be declared inside a contract, in which case it has access to the contracts
contract storage variables, other contract functions etc. Functions can be also be declared outside
a contract.

.. code-block:: javascript

    /// get_initial_bound is called from the constructor
    function get_initial_bound() returns (uint value) {
        value = 102;
    }

    contact foo {
        uint bound = get_initial_bound();

        /** set bound for get with bound */
        function set_bound(uint _bound) public {
            bound = _bound;
        }

        /// Clamp a value within a bound.
        /// The bound can be set with set_bound().
        function get_with_bound(uint value) view public return (uint) {
            if (value < bound) {
                return value;
            } else {
                return bound;
            }
        }
    }

Function can have any number of arguments. Function arguments may have names;
if they do not have names then they cannot be used in the function body, but they will
be present in the public interface.

The return values may have names as demonstrated in the get_initial_bound() function.
When at all of the return values have a name, then the return statement is no
longer required at the end of a function body. In stead of returning the values
which are provided in the return statement, the values of the return variables at the end
of the function is returned. It is still possible to explicitly return some values
with a return statement.

Functions which are declared ``public`` will be present in the ABI and are callable
externally. If a function is declared ``private`` then it is not callable externally,
but it can be called from within the contract. If a function is defined outside a
contract, then it cannot have a visibility specifier (e.g. ``public``).

Any DocComment before a function will be include in the ABI. Currently only Substrate
supports documentation in the ABI.

Arguments passing and return values
___________________________________

Function arguments can be passed either by position or by name. When they are called
by name, arguments can be in any order. However, functions with anonymous arguments
(arguments without name) cannot be called this way.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function bar(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (uint32) {
            if (y) {
                return 2;
            }

            return 3;
        }

        function test() public {
            uint32 a = bar(102, false);
            a = bar({ y: true, x: 302 });
        }
    }

If the function has a single return value, this can be assigned to a variable. If
the function has multiple return values, these can be assigned using the :ref:`destructuring`
assignment statement:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function bar1(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (address, byte32) {
            return (address(3), hex"01020304");
        }

        function bar2(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (bool) {
            return !y;
        }

        function test() public {
            (address f1, bytes32 f2) = bar1(102, false);
            bool f3 = bar2({x: 255, y: true})
        }
    }

It is also possible to call functions on other contracts, which is also known as calling
external functions. The called function must be declared public.
Calling external functions requires ABI encoding the arguments, and ABI decoding the
return values. This much more costly than an internal function call.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function bar1(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (address, byte32) {
            return (address(3), hex"01020304");
        }

        function bar2(uint32 x, bool y) public returns (bool) {
            return !y;
        }
    }

    contract bar {
        function test(foo f) public {
            (address f1, bytes32 f2) = f.bar1(102, false);
            bool f3 = f.bar2({x: 255, y: true})
        }
    }

The syntax for calling external call is the same as the external call, except for
that it must be done on a contract type variable. Any error in an external call can
be handled with :ref:`try-catch`.

Passing value and gas with external calls
_________________________________________

For external calls, value can be sent along with the call. The callee must be
``payable``. Likewise, a gas limit can be set.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo {
        function bar() public {
            other o = new other();

            o.feh{value: 102, gas: 5000}(102);
        }
    }

    contract other {
        function feh(uint32 x) public payable {
            // ...
        }
    }

.. note::
    The gas cannot be set on Solana for external calls.


State mutability
________________

Some functions only read contract storage (also known as *state*), and others may write
contract storage. Functions that do not write state can be executed off-chain. Off-chain
execution is faster, does not require write access, and does not need any balance.

Functions that do not write state come in two flavours: ``view`` and ``pure``. ``pure``
functions may not read state, and ``view`` functions that do read state.

Functions that do write state come in two flavours: ``payable`` and non-payable, the
default. Functions that are not intended to receive any value, should not be marked
``payable``. The compiler will check that every call does not included any value, and
there are runtime checks as well, which cause the function to be reverted if value is
sent.

A constructor can be marked ``payable``, in which case value can be passed with the
constructor.

.. note::
    If value is sent to a non-payable function on Parity Substrate, the call will be
    reverted. However there is no refund performed, so value will remain with the callee.

    ``payable`` on constructors is not enforced on Parity Substrate. Funds are needed
    for storage rent and there is a minimum deposit needed for the contract. As a result,
    constructors always receive value on Parity Substrate.

Function overloading
____________________

Multiple functions with the same name can be declared, as long as the arguments are
different in at least one of two ways:

- The number of arguments must be different
- The type of at least one of the arguments is different

A function cannot be overloaded by changing the return types or number of returned
values. Here is an example of an overloaded function:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract shape {
      int64 bar;

      function abs(int val) public returns (int) {
          if (val >= 0) {
              return val;
          } else {
              return -val;
          }
      }

      function abs(int64 val) public returns (int64) {
          if (val >= 0) {
              return val;
          } else {
              return -val;
          }
      }

      function foo(int64 x) public {
          bar = abs(x);
      }
  }

In the function foo, abs() is called with an ``int64`` so the second implementation
of the function abs() is called.

Function Modifiers
__________________

Function modifiers are used to check pre-conditions or post-conditions for a function call. First a
new modifier must be declared which looks much like a function, but uses the ``modifier``
keyword rather than ``function``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        address owner;

        modifier only_owner() {
            require(msg.sender == owner);
            _;
            // insert post conditions here
        }

        function foo() only_owner public {
            // ...
        }
    }

The function `foo` can only be run by the owner of the contract, else the ``require()`` in its
modifier will fail. The special symbol ``_;`` will be replaced by body of the function. In fact,
if you specify ``_;`` twice, the function will execute twice, which might not be a good idea.

A modifier cannot have visibility (e.g. ``public``) or mutability (e.g. ``view``) specified,
since a modifier is never externally callable. Modifiers can only be used by attaching them
to functions.

A modifier can have arguments, just like regular functions. Here if the price is less
than 50, `foo()` itself will never be executed, and execution will return to the caller with
nothing done since ``_;`` is not reached in the modifier and as result foo() is never
executed.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        modifier check_price(int64 price) {
            if (price >= 50) {
                _;
            }
        }

        function foo(int64 price) check_price(price) public {
            // ...
        }
    }

Multiple modifiers can be applied to single function. The modifiers are executed in the
order of the modifiers specified on the function declaration. Execution will continue to the next modifier
when the ``_;`` is reached. In
this example, the `only_owner` modifier is run first, and if that reaches ``_;``, then
`check_price` is executed. The body of function `foo()` is only reached once `check_price()`
reaches ``_;``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract example {
        address owner;

        // a modifier with no arguments does not need "()" in its declaration
        modifier only_owner {
            require(msg.sender == owner);
            _;
        }

        modifier check_price(int64 price) {
            if (price >= 50) {
                _;
            }
        }

        function foo(int64 price) only_owner check_price(price) public {
            // ...
        }
    }

Modifiers can be inherited or declared ``virtual`` in a base contract and then overriden, exactly like
functions can be.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract base {
        address owner;

        modifier only_owner {
            require(msg.sender == owner);
            _;
        }

        modifier check_price(int64 price) virtual {
            if (price >= 10) {
                _;
            }
        }
    }

    contract example is base {
        modifier check_price(int64 price) override {
            if (price >= 50) {
                _;
            }
        }

        function foo(int64 price) only_owner check_price(price) public {
            // ...
        }
    }


Calling an external function using ``call()``
_____________________________________________

If you call a function on a contract, then the function selector and any arguments
are ABI encoded for you, and any return values are decoded. Sometimes it is useful
to call a function without abi encoding the arguments.

You can call a contract directly by using the ``call()`` method on the address type.
This takes a single argument, which should be the ABI encoded arguments. The return
values are a ``boolean`` which indicates success if true, and the ABI encoded
return value in ``bytes``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract a {
        function test() public {
            b v = new b();

            // the following four lines are equivalent to "uint32 res = v.foo(3,5);"

            // Note that the signature is only hashed and not parsed. So, ensure that the
            // arguments are of the correct type.
            bytes data = abi.encodeWithSignature("foo(uint32,uint32)", uint32(3), uint32(5));

            (bool success, bytes rawresult) = address(v).call(data);

            assert(success == true);

            uint32 res = abi.decode(rawresult, (uint32));

            assert(res == 8);
        }
    }

    contract b {
        function foo(uint32 a, uint32 b) public returns (uint32) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }

Any value or gas limit can be specified for the external call. Note that no check is done to see
if the called function is ``payable``, since the compiler does not know what function you are
calling.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function test(address foo, bytes rawcalldata) public {
        (bool success, bytes rawresult) = foo.call{value: 102, gas: 1000}(rawcalldata);
    }

.. note::

    ewasm also supports ``staticcall()`` and ``delegatecall()`` on the address type. These
    call types are not supported on Parity Substrate.

fallback() and receive() function
_________________________________

When a function is called externally, either via an transaction or when one contract
call a function on another contract, the correct function is dispatched based on the
function selector in the raw encoded ABI call data. If there is no match, the call
reverts, unless there is a ``fallback()`` or ``receive()`` function defined.

If the call comes with value, then ``receive()`` is executed, otherwise ``fallback()``
is executed. This made clear in the declarations; ``receive()`` must be declared
``payable``, and ``fallback()`` must not be declared ``payable``. If a call is made
with value and no ``receive()`` function is defined, then the call reverts, likewise if
call is made without value and no ``fallback()`` is defined, then the call also reverts.

Both functions must be declared ``external``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract test {
        int32 bar;

        function foo(uint32 x) public {
            bar = x;
        }

        fallback() external {
            // execute if function selector does not match "foo(uint32)" and no value sent
        }

        receive() payable external {
            // execute if function selector does not match "foo(uint32)" and value sent
        }
    }

Constants
---------

Constants can be declared at the global level or at the contract level, just like contract
storage variables. They do not use any contract storage and cannot be modified.
The variable must have an initializer, which must be a constant expression. It is
not allowed to call functions or read variables in the initializer:

.. code-block:: javascript

    string constant greeting = "Hello, World!";

    contract ethereum {
        uint constant byzantium_block = 4_370_000;
    }

Contract Storage
----------------

Any variables declared at the contract level (so not declared in a function or constructor),
will automatically become contract storage. Contract storage is maintained on chain, so they
retain their values between calls. These are declared so:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract hitcount {
      uint public counter = 1;

      function hit() public {
          counters++;
      }
  }

The ``counter`` is maintained for each deployed ``hitcount`` contract. When the contract is deployed,
the contract storage is set to 1. Contract storage variable do not need an initializer; when
it is not present, it is initialized to 0, or ``false`` if it is a ``bool``.

Immutable Variables
___________________

A variable can be declared `immutable`. This means that it may only be modified in a constructor,
and not in any other function or modifier.

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract foo {
      uint public immutable bar;

      constructor(int v) {
        bar = v;
      }

      function hit() public {
        // this is not permitted
        bar++;
      }
  }

This is purely a compiler syntax feature, the generated code is exactly the same.

Accessor Functions
__________________

Any contract storage variable which is declared public, automatically gets an accessor function. This
function has the same name as the variable name. So, in the example above, the value of counter can
retrieved by calling a function called ``counter``, which returns ``uint``.

If the type is either an array or a mapping, the key or array indices become arguments to the accessor
function.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract ethereum {
        // As a public mapping,this creates accessor function called balance, which takes
        // an address as an argument, and returns an uint
        mapping(address => uint) public balances;

        // A public array takes the index as an uint argument and returns the element,
        // in this case string.
        string[] users;
    }

The accessor function may override a method on a base contract by specifying ``override``. The base function
must be virtual and have the same signature as the accessor. The ``override`` keyword only affects the
accessor function, so it can only be used in combination with public variables and cannot be used to
override a variable in the base contract.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract foo is bar {
        int public override baz;
    }

    contract bar {
        function baz() public virtual returns (int) {
            return 512;
        }
    }


How to clear Contract Storage
_____________________________

Any contract storage variable can have its underlying contract storage cleared with the ``delete``
operator. This can be done on any type; a simple integer, an array element, or the entire
array itself. Contract storage has to be cleared slot (i.e. primitive) at a time, so if there are
many primitives, this can be costly.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract s {
        struct user {
            address f1;
            int[] list;
        }
        user[1000] users;

        function clear() public {
            // delete has to iterate over 1000 users, and for each of those clear the
            // f1 field, read the length of the list, and iterate over each of those
            delete users;
        }
    }

Events
------

In Solidity, contracts can emit events that signal that changes have occurred. For example, a Solidity
contract could emit a `Deposit` event, or `BetPlaced` in a poker game. These events are stored
in the blockchain transaction log, so they become part of the permanent record. From Solidity's perspective,
you can emit events but you cannot access events on the chain.

Once those events are added to the chain, an off-chain application can listen for events. For example, the Web3.js
interface has a `subscribe()` function. Another is example is
`Hyperledger Burrow <https://hyperledger.github.io/burrow/#/reference/vent>`_
which has a vent command which listens to events and inserts them into a Postgres database.

An event has two parts. First, there is a limited set of topics. Usually there are no more than 3 topics,
and each of those has a fixed length of 32 bytes. They are there so that an application listening for events
can easily filter for particular types of events, without needing to do any decoding. There is also a data
section of variable length bytes, which is ABI encoded. To decode this part, the ABI for the event must be known.

From Solidity's perspective, an event has a name, and zero or more fields. The fields can either be ``indexed`` or
not. ``indexed`` fields are stored as topics, so there can only be a limited number of ``indexed`` fields. The other
fields are stored in the data section of the event. The event name does not need to be unique; just like
functions, they can be overloaded as long as the fields are of different types, or the event has
a different number of arguments.
In Parity Substrate, the topic fields are always the hash of the value of the field. Ethereum only hashes fields
which do not fit in the 32 bytes. Since a cryptographic hash is used, it is only possible to compare the topic against a
known value.

An event can be declared in a contract, or outside.

.. code-block:: javascript

    event CounterpartySigned (
        address indexed party,
        address counter_party,
        uint contract_no
    );

    contract Signer {
        funtion sign(address counter_party, uint contract_no) internal {
            emit CounterpartySigned(address(this), counter_party, contract_no);
        }
    }

Like function calls, the emit statement can have the fields specified by position, or by field name. Using
field names rather than position may be useful in case the event name is overloaded, since the field names
make it clearer which exact event is being emitted.


.. code-block:: javascript

    event UserModified(
        address user,
        string name
    ) anonymous;

    event UserModified(
        address user,
        uint64 groupid
    );

    contract user {
        function set_name(string name) public {
            emit UserModified({ user: msg.sender, name: name });
        }

        function set_groupid(uint64 id) public {
            emit UserModified({ user: msg.sender, groupid: id });
        }
    }

In the transaction log, the first topic of an event is the keccak256 hash of the signature of the
event. The signature is the event name, followed by the fields types in a comma separated list in parentheses. So
the first topic for the second UserModified event would be the keccak256 hash of ``UserModified(address,uint64)``.
You can leave this topic out by declaring the event ``anonymous``. This makes the event slightly smaller (32 bytes
less) and makes it possible to have 4 ``indexed`` fields rather than 3.


Constructors and contract instantiation
---------------------------------------

When a contract is deployed, the contract storage is initialized to the initializer values provided,
and any constructor is called. A constructor is not required for a contract. A constructor is defined
like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

  contract mycontract {
      uint foo;

      constructor(uint foo_value) {
          foo = foo_value;
      }
  }

A constructor does not have a name and may have any number of arguments. If a constructor has arguments,
then when the contract is deployed then those arguments must be supplied.

If a contract is expected to hold receive value on instantiation, the constructor should be declared ``payable``.

.. note::

  Parity Substrate allows multiple constructors to be defined, which is not true for
  ewasm. So, when building for Substrate, multiple constructors can be
  defined as long as their argument list is different (i.e. overloaded).

  When the contract is deployed in the Polkadot UI, the user can select the constructor to be used.

Instantiation using new
_______________________

Contracts can be created using the ``new`` keyword. The contract that is being created might have
constructor arguments, which need to be provided.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact hatchling {
        string name;

        constructor(string id) {
            require(id != "", "name must be provided");
            name = id;
        }
    }

    contract adult {
        function test() public {
            hatchling h = new hatchling("luna");
        }
    }

The constructor might fail for various reasons, for example ``require()`` might fail here. This can
be handled using the :ref:`try-catch` statement, else errors cause the transaction to fail.

Sending value to the new contract
_________________________________

It is possible to send value to the new contract. This can be done with the ``{value: 500}``
syntax, like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact hatchling {
        string name;

        constructor(string id) payable {
            require(id != "", "name must be provided");
            name = id;
        }
    }

    contract adult {
        function test() public {
            hatchling h = new hatchling{value: 500}("luna");
        }
    }

The constructor should be declared ``payable`` for this to work.

.. note::
    If no value is specified, then on Parity Substrate the minimum balance (also know as the
    existential deposit) is sent.

Setting the salt, gas, and space for the new contract
_____________________________________________________

.. note::
    `ewasm <https://github.com/ewasm/design/blob/master/eth_interface.md>`_ does not
    yet provide a method for setting the salt or gas for the new contract, so
    these values are ignored.

.. note::
    The gas or salt cannot be set on Solana. However, when creating a contract
    on Solana, the size of the new account can be set using `space:`.

When a new contract is created, the address for the new contract is a hash of the input
(the constructor arguments) to the new contract. So, a contract cannot be created twice
with the same input. This is why the salt is concatenated to the input. The salt is
either a random value or it can be explicitly set using the ``{salt: 2}`` syntax. A
constant will remove the need for the runtime random generation, however creating
a contract twice with the same salt and arguments will fail. The salt is of type
``uint256``.

If gas is specified, this limits the amount gas the constructor for the new contract
can use. gas is a ``uint64``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact hatchling {
        string name;

        constructor(string id) payable {
            require(id != "", "name must be provided");
            name = id;
        }
    }

    contract adult {
        function test() public {
            hatchling h = new hatchling{salt: 0, gas: 10000}("luna");
        }
    }

When creating contract on Solana, the size of the new account can be specified using
`space:`. By default, the new account is created with a size of 1 kilobyte (1024 bytes)
plus the size required for any fixed-size fields. When you specify space, this is
the space in addition to the fixed-size fields. So, if you specify `space: 0`, then there is
no space for any dynamicially allocated fields.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact hatchling {
        string name;

        constructor(string id) payable {
            require(id != "", "name must be provided");
            name = id;
        }
    }

    contract adult {
        function test() public {
            hatchling h = new hatchling{space: 10240}("luna");
        }
    }


Base contracts, abstract contracts and interfaces
-------------------------------------------------

Solidity contracts support object-oriented programming. The style Solidity is somewhat similar to C++,
but there are many differences. In Solidity we are dealing with contracts, not classes.

Specifying base contracts
_________________________

To inherit from another contract, you have to specify it as a base contract. Multiple contracts can
be specified here.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact a is b, c {
        constructor() {}
    }

    contact b {
        int foo;
        function func2() public {}
        constructor() {}
    }

    contact c {
        int bar;
        constructor() {}
        function func1() public {}
    }

In this case, contract ``a`` inherits from both ``b`` and ``c``. Both ``func1()`` and ``func2()``
are visible in contract ``a``, and will be part of its public interface if they are declared ``public`` or
``external``. In addition, the contract storage variables ``foo`` and ``bar`` are also availabe in ``a``.

Inheriting contracts is recursive; this means that if you inherit a contract, you also inherit everything
that that contract inherits. In this example, contract ``a`` inherits ``b`` directly, and inherits ``c``
through ``b``. This means that contract ``b`` also has a variable ``bar``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact a is b {
        constructor() {}
    }

    contact b is c {
        int foo;
        function func2() public {}
        constructor() {}
    }

    contact c {
        int bar;
        constructor() {}
        function func1() public {}
    }

Virtual Functions
_________________

When inheriting from a base contract, it is possible to override a function with a newer function with the same name.
For this to be possible, the base contract must have specified the function as ``virtual``. The
inheriting contract must then specify the same function with the same name, arguments and return values, and
add the ``override`` keyword.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact a is b {
        function func(int a) override public returns (int) {
            return a + 11;
        }
    }

    contact b {
        function func(int a) virtual public returns (int) {
            return a + 10;
        }
    }

If the function is present in more than one base contract, the ``override`` attribute must list all the base
contracts it is overriding.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact a is b,c {
        function func(int a) override(b,c) public returns (int) {
            return a + 11;
        }
    }

    contact b {
        function func(int a) virtual public returns (int) {
            return a + 10;
        }
    }

    contact c {
        function func(int a) virtual public returns (int) {
            return a + 5;
        }
    }

Calling function in base contract
_________________________________

When a virtual function is called, the dispatch is *virtual*. If the function being called is
overriden in another contract, then the overriding function is called. For example:


.. code-block:: javascript

    contract a is b {
        function baz() public returns (uint64) {
            return foo();
        }

        function foo() internal override returns (uint64) {
            return 2;
        }
    }

    contract a {
        function foo() internal virtual returns (uint64) {
            return 1;
        }

        function bar() internal returns (uint64) {
            // since foo() is virtual, is a virtual dispatch call
            // when foo is called and a is a base contract of b, then foo in contract b will
            // be called; foo will return 2.
            return foo();
        }

        function bar2() internal returns (uint64) {
            // this explicitly says "call foo of base contract a", and dispatch is not virtual
            return a.foo();
        }
    }

Rather than specifying the base contract, use ``super`` as the contract to call the base contract
function.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract a is b {
        function baz() public returns (uint64) {
            // this will return 1
            return super.foo();
        }

        function foo() internal override returns (uint64) {
            return 2;
        }
    }

    contract b {
        function foo() internal virtual returns (uint64) {
            return 1;
        }
    }

If there are multiple base contracts which the define the same function, the function of the first base
contract is called.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract a is b1, b2 {
        function baz() public returns (uint64) {
            // this will return 100
            return super.foo();
        }

        function foo() internal override(b2, b2) returns (uint64) {
            return 2;
        }
    }

    contract b1 {
        function foo() internal virtual returns (uint64) {
            return 100;
        }
   }

    contract b2 {
        function foo() internal virtual returns (uint64) {
            return 200;
        }
    }


Specifying constructor arguments
________________________________

If a contract inherits another contract, then when it is instantiated or deployed, then the constructor for
its inherited contracts is called. The constructor arguments can be specified on the base contract itself.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact a is b(1) {
        constructor() {}
    }

    contact b is c(2) {
        int foo;
        function func2(int i) public {}
        constructor() {}
    }

    contact c {
        int bar;
        constructor(int32 j) {}
        function func1() public {}
    }

When ``a`` is deployed, the constructor for ``c`` is executed first, then ``b``, and lastly ``a``. When the
constructor arguments are specified on the base contract, the values must be constant. It is possible to specify
the base arguments on the constructor for inheriting contract. Now we have access to the constructor arguments,
which means we can have runtime-defined arguments to the inheriting constructors.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contact a is b {
        constructor(int i) b(i+2) {}
    }

    contact b is c {
        int foo;
        function func2() public {}
        constructor(int j) c(j+3) {}
    }

    contact c {
        int bar;
        constructor(int32 k) {}
        function func1() public {}
    }

The execution is not entirely intuitive in this case. When contract ``a`` is deployed with an int argument of 10,
then first the constructor argument or contract ``b`` is calculated: 10+2, and that value is used as an
argument to constructor ``b``. constructor ``b`` calculates the arguments for constructor ``c`` to be: 12+3. Now,
with all the arguments for all the constructors established, constructor ``c`` is executed with argument 15, then
constructor ``b`` with argument 12, and lastly constructor ``a`` with the original argument 10.

Abstract Contracts
__________________

An ``abstract contract`` is one that cannot be instantiated, but it can be used as a base for another contract,
which can be instantiated. A contract can be abstract because the functions it defines do not have a body,
for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    abstract contact a {
        function func2() virtual public;
    }

This contract cannot be instantiated, since there is no body or implementation for ``func2``. Another contract
can define this contract as a base contract and override ``func2`` with a body.

Another reason why a contract must be abstract is missing constructor arguments. In this case, if we were to
instantiate contract ``a`` we would not know what the constructor arguments to its base ``b`` would have to be.
Note that contract ``c`` does inherit from ``a`` and can specify the arguments for ``b`` on its constructor,
even though ``c`` does not directly inherit ``b`` (but does indirectly).

.. code-block:: javascript

    abstract contact a is b {
        constructor() {}
    }

    contact b {
        constructor(int j) {}
    }

    contract c is a {
        constructor(int k) b(k*2) {}
    }

Interfaces
__________

An interface is a contract sugar type with restrictions. This type cannot be instantiated; it can only define the
functions prototypes for a contract. This is useful as a generic interface.

.. code-block:: javascript

    interface operator {
        function op1(int32 a, int32 b) external returns (int32);
        function op2(int32 a, int32 b) external returns (int32);
    }

    contract ferqu {
        operator op;

        constructor(bool do_adds) {
            if (do_adds) {
                op = new m1();
            } else {
                op = new m2();
            }
        }

        function x(int32 b) public returns (int32) {
            return op.op1(102, b);
        }
    }

    contract m1 is operator {
        function op1(int32 a, int32 b) public override returns (int32) {
            return a + b;
        }

        function op2(int32 a, int32 b) public override returns (int32) {
            return a - b;
        }
    }

    contract m2 is operator {
        function op1(int32 a, int32 b) public override returns (int32) {
            return a * b;
        }

        function op2(int32 a, int32 b) public override returns (int32) {
            return a / b;
        }
    }

- Interfaces can only have other interfaces as a base contract
- All functions must the ``external`` visibilty
- No constructor can be declared
- No contract storage variables can exist (however constants are allowed)
- No function can have a body or implementation

Libraries
_________

Libraries are a special type of contract which can be reused in multiple contracts. Functions declared in a library can
be called with the ``library.function()`` syntax. When the library has been imported or declared, any contract
can use its functions simply by using its name.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract test {
        function foo(uint64 x) public pure returns (uint64) {
            return ints.max(x, 65536);
        }
    }

    library ints {
        function max(uint64 a, uint64 b) public pure returns (uint64) {
            return a > b ? a : b;
        }
    }

When writing libraries there are restrictions compared to contracts:

- A library cannot have constructors, fallback or receive function
- A library cannot have base contracts
- A library cannot be a base contract
- A library cannot have virtual or override functions
- A library cannot have payable functions

.. note::

    When using the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler, library are a special contract type and libraries are
    called using `delegatecall`. Parity Substrate has no ``delegatecall`` functionality so Solang statically
    links the library calls into your contract code. This does make for larger contract code, however this
    reduces the call overhead and make it possible to do compiler optimizations across library and contract code.

Library Using For
_________________

Libraries can be used as method calls on variables. The type of the variable needs to be bound to the
library, and the type of the first parameter of the function of the library must match the type of a
variable.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract test {
        using lib for int32[100];

        int32[100] bar;

        function foo() public returns (int64) {
            bar.set(10, 571);
        }
    }

    library lib {
        function set(int32[100] storage a, uint index, int32 val) internal {
            a[index] = val;
        }
    }

The syntax ``using`` `library` ``for`` `Type` ``;`` is the syntax that binds the library to the type. This
must be specified on the contract. This binds library ``lib`` to any variable with type ``int32[100]``.
As a result of this, any method call on a variable of type ``int32[100]`` will be matched to library ``lib``.

For the call to match, the first argument of the function must match the variable; note that here, `bar`
is of type ``storage``, since all contract variables are implicitly ``storage``.

There is an alternative syntax ``using`` `library` ``for *;`` which binds the library functions to any
variable that will match according to these rules.

Sending and receiving value
---------------------------

Value in Solidity is represented by ``uint128``.

.. note::

    Parity Substrate can be compiled with a different type for ``T::Balance``. If you
    need support for a different type, please raise an
    `issue <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/issues>`_.

Checking your balance
_____________________

The balance of a contract can be checked with `address` ``.balance``, so your own balance
is ``address(this).balance``.

.. note::
    Parity Substrate cannot check the balance for contracts other than the current
    one. If you need to check the balance of another contract, then add a balance
    function to that contract like the one below, and call that function instead.

.. code-block:: javascript

    function balance() public returns (uint128) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

Creating contracts with an initial value
________________________________________

You can specify the value you want to be deposited in the new contract by
specifying ``{value: 100 ether}`` before the constructor arguments. This is
explained in `sending value to the new contract`_.

Sending value with an external call
___________________________________

You can specify the value you want to be sent along with the function call by
specifying ``{value: 100 ether}`` before the function arguments. This is
explained in `passing value and gas with external calls`_.

.. _send_transfer:

Sending value using ``send()`` and ``transfer()``
_________________________________________________

The ``send()`` and ``transfer()`` functions are available as method on a
``address payable`` variable. The single arguments is the amount of value you
would like to send. The difference between the two functions is what happens
in the failure case: ``transfer()`` will revert the current call, ``send()``
returns a ``bool`` which will be ``false``.

In order for the receiving contract to receive the value, it needs a ``receive()``
function, see `fallback() and receive() function`_.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract A {
        B other;

        constructor() {
            other = new B();

            bool complete = payable(other).transfer(100);

            if (!complete) {
                // oops
            }

            // if the following fails, our transaction will fail
            other.send(100);
        }
    }

    contract B {
        receive() payable external {
            // ..
        }
    }

.. note::
    On Subtrate, this uses the ``seal_transfer()`` mechanism rather than ``seal_call()``, since this
    does not come with gas overhead. This means the ``receive()`` function is not required in the
    receiving contract, and it will not be called if it is present. If you want the ``receive()``
    function to be called, use ``address.call{value: 100}("")`` instead.


Builtin Functions and Variables
-------------------------------

The Solidity language has a number of built-in variables and functions which give
access to the chain environment or pre-defined functions. Some of these functions will
be different on different chains.

Block and transaction
_____________________

The functions and variables give access to block properties like block
number and transaction properties like gas used, and value sent.

gasleft() returns (uint64)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Returns the amount of gas remaining the current transaction.

.. note::
    ``gasleft()`` is not available on Solana.

    Gasprice is not used on Solana. There is compute budget which may not be
    exceeded, but there is no charge based on compute units used.

blockhash(uint64 block) returns (bytes32)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Returns the blockhash for a particular block. This not possible for the current
block, or any block except for the most recent 256. Do not use this a source of
randomness unless you know what you are doing.

.. note::
    This function is not available on Parity Substrate. When using Parity Substrate,
    use ``random()`` as a source of random data.

.. note::
    This function is not available on Solana. There is the
    `recent block hashes account <https://edge.docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars#recentblockhashes>`_
    that looks useful at first glance, however it is not usable because:

    - This account is `deprecated <https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/18875>`_.
    - It does not give any slot of block number, so it is not possible to provide a matching
      function signature.

random(bytes subject) returns (bytes32)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Returns random bytes based on the subject. The same subject for the same transaction
will return the same random bytes, so the result is deterministic. The chain has
a ``max_subject_len``, and if *subject* exceeds that, the transaction will be aborted.

.. note::

    This function is only available on Parity Substrate.

``msg`` properties
++++++++++++++++++

uint128 ``msg.value``
    The amount of value sent with a transaction, or 0 if no value was sent.

bytes ``msg.data``
    The raw ABI encoded arguments passed to the current call.

bytes4 ``msg.sig``
    Function selector from the ABI encoded calldata, e.g. the first four bytes. This
    might be 0 if no function selector was present. In Ethereum, constructor calls do not
    have function selectors but in Parity Substrate they do.

address ``msg.sender``
    The sender of the current call. This is either the address of the contract
    that called the current contract, or the address that started the transaction
    if it called the current contract directly.

``tx`` properties
+++++++++++++++++

.. _gasprice:

uint128 ``tx.gasprice``
    The price of one unit of gas, only available with the ewasm target.
    This field cannot be used on Parity Substrate, the explanation
    is in the warning box below.

.. note::
    ``tx.gasprice`` is not available on Solana.

    gasprice is not used on Solana. There is compute budget which may not be
    exceeded, but there is no charge based on compute units used.

uint128 ``tx.gasprice(uint64 gas)``
    The total price of `gas` units of gas.

.. warning::
    On Parity Substrate, the cost of one gas unit may not be an exact whole round value. In fact,
    if the gas price is less than 1 it may round down to 0, giving the incorrect appearance gas is free.
    Therefore, avoid the ``tx.gasprice`` member in favour of the function ``tx.gasprice(uint64 gas)``.

    To avoid rounding errors, pass the total amount of gas into ``tx.gasprice(uint64 gas)`` rather than
    doing arithmetic on the result. As an example, **replace** this bad example:

    .. code-block:: solidity

        // BAD example
        uint128 cost = num_items * tx.gasprice(gas_per_item);

    with:

    .. code-block:: solidity

        uint128 cost = tx.gasprice(num_items * gas_per_item);

    Note this function is not available on the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler.

address ``tx.origin``
    The address that started this transaction. Not available on Parity Substrate or Solana.


``block`` properties
++++++++++++++++++++++

Some block properties are always available:

uint64 ``block.number``
    The current block number.

uint64 ``block.timestamp``
    The time in unix epoch, i.e. seconds since the beginning of 1970.

Do not use either of these two fields as a source of randomness unless you know what
you are doing.

The other block properties depend on which chain is being used.

.. note::
    Solana requires the `clock account <https://edge.docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars#clock>`_
    to present in the account for the instruction to use any of the ``block`` fields.

    On Solana, ``block.number`` gives the slot number rather than the block height.
    For processing, you want to use the slot rather the block height. Slots
    include empty blocks, which do not count towards the block height.

Solana
~~~~~~

uint64 ``block.slot``
    The current slot. This is an alias for ``block.number``.

Parity Substrate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

uint128 ``block.tombstone_deposit``
    The amount needed for a tombstone. Without it, contracts will disappear
    completely if the balance runs out.

uint128 ``block.minimum_deposit``
    The minimum amonut needed to create a contract. This does not include
    storage rent.

Ethereum
~~~~~~~~

uint64 ``block.gaslimit``
    The current block gas limit.

address payable ``block.coinbase``
    The current block miner's address.

uint256 ``block.difficulty``
    The current block's difficulty.


Error handling
______________

assert(bool)
++++++++++++

Assert takes a boolean argument. If that evaluates to false, execution is aborted.


.. code-block:: javascript

    contract c {
        constructor(int x) {
            assert(x > 0);
        }
    }

revert() or revert(string)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

revert aborts execution of the current contract, and returns to the caller. revert()
can be called with no arguments, or a single `string` argument, which is called the
`ReasonCode`. This function can be called at any point, either in a constructor or
a function.

If the caller is another contract, it can use the `ReasonCode` in a :ref:`try-catch`
statement.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract x {
        constructor(address foobar) {
            if (a == address(0)) {
                revert("foobar must a valid address");
            }
        }
    }

require(bool) or require(bool, string)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This function is used to check that a condition holds true, or abort execution otherwise. So,
if the first `bool` argument is `true`, this function does nothing, however
if the `bool` arguments is `false`, then execution is aborted. There is an optional second
`string` argument which is called the `ReasonCode`, which can be used by the caller
to identify what the problem is.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract x {
        constructor(address foobar) {
            require(foobar != address(0), "foobar must a valid address");
        }
    }


ABI encoding and decoding
_________________________

The ABI encoding depends on the target being compiled for. Substrate uses the
`SCALE Codec <https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/codec>`_ and ewasm uses
`Ethereum ABI encoding <https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.6/abi-spec.html>`_.

abi.decode(bytes, (*type-list*))
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This function decodes the first argument and returns the decoded fields. *type-list* is a comma-separated
list of types. If multiple values are decoded, then a destructure statement must be used.

.. code-block:: javascript

    uint64 foo = abi.decode(bar, (uint64));

.. code-block:: javascript

    (uint64 foo1, bool foo2) = abi.decode(bar, (uint64, bool));

If the arguments cannot be decoded, contract execution will abort. This can happen if the encoded
length is too short, for example.


abi.encode(...)
+++++++++++++++

ABI encodes the arguments to bytes. Any number of arguments can be provided.

.. code-block:: javascript

    uint16 x = 241;
    bytes foo = abi.encode(x);

On Substrate, foo will be ``hex"f100"``. On Ethereum this will be ``hex"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f1"``.

abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4 selector, ...)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ABI encodes the arguments with the function selector first. After the selector, any number of arguments
can be provided.

.. code-block:: javascript

    bytes foo = abi.encodeWithSelector(hex"01020304", uint16(0xff00), "ABCD");

On Substrate, foo will be ``hex"0403020100ff"``. On Ethereum this will be ``hex"01020304000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ff00"``.

abi.encodeWithSignature(string signature, ...)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ABI encodes the arguments with the ``bytes4`` hash of the signature. After the signature, any number of arguments
can be provided. This is equivalent to ``abi.encodeWithSignature(bytes4(keccak256(signature)), ...)``.

.. code-block:: javascript

    bytes foo = abi.encodeWithSignature("test2(uint64)", uint64(257));

On Substrate, foo will be ``hex"296dacf0_0101_0000__0000_0000"``. On Ethereum this will be ``hex"296dacf0_0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101"``.

abi.encodePacked(...)
+++++++++++++++++++++

ABI encodes the arguments to bytes. Any number of arguments can be provided. The packed encoding only
encodes the raw data, not the lengths of strings and arrays. For example, when encoding ``string`` only the string
bytes will be encoded, not the length. It is not possible to decode packed encoding.

.. code-block:: javascript

    bytes foo = abi.encode(uint16(0xff00), "ABCD");

On Substrate, foo will be ``hex"00ff41424344"``. On Ethereum this will be ``hex"ff0041424344"``.

Cryptography
____________

keccak256(bytes)
++++++++++++++++

This returns the ``bytes32`` keccak256 hash of the bytes.

ripemd160(bytes)
++++++++++++++++

This returns the ``bytes20`` ripemd160 hash of the bytes.

sha256(bytes)
+++++++++++++

This returns the ``bytes32`` sha256 hash of the bytes.

blake2_128(bytes)
+++++++++++++++++

This returns the ``bytes16`` blake2_128 hash of the bytes.

.. note::

    This function is only available on Parity Substrate.

blake2_256(bytes)
+++++++++++++++++

This returns the ``bytes32`` blake2_256 hash of the bytes.

.. note::

    This function is only available on Parity Substrate.

signatureVerify(address public_key, bytes message, bytes signature)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Verify the ed25519 signature given the public key, message, and signature. This
function returns ``true`` if the signature matches, ``false`` otherwise.

The transactions which executes this function, needs an
`ed25519 program <https://edge.docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#ed25519-program>`_
instruction with matching public key, message, and signature.
In order to examine the instruction, the
`instructions sysvar <https://edge.docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/sysvars#instructions>`_
needs be in the accounts for the Solidity instruction as well.

.. note::

   This function is only available on Solana.

Mathematical
____________

addmod(uint x, uint y, uint, k) returns (uint)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Add x to y, and then divides by k. x + y will not overflow.

mulmod(uint x, uint y, uint, k) returns (uint)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Multiply x with y, and then divides by k. x * y will not overflow.

Miscellaneous
_____________

print(string)
+++++++++++++

print() takes a string argument.

.. code-block:: javascript

    contract c {
        constructor() {
            print("Hello, world!");
        }
    }

.. note::

  print() is not available with the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler.

  When using Substrate, this function is only available on development chains.
  If you use this function on a production chain, the contract will fail to load.

  When using ewasm, the function is only available on hera when compiled with
  debugging.

.. _selfdestruct:

selfdestruct(address payable recipient)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``selfdestruct()`` function causes the current contract to be deleted, and any
remaining balance to be sent to `recipient`. This functions does not return, as the
contract no longer exists.

.. note::
    This function does not exist on Solana.

String formatting using ``"{}".format()``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes it is useful to convert an integer to a string, e.g. for debugging purposes. There is
a format builtin function for this, which is a method on string literals. Each ``{}`` in the
string will be replaced with the value of an argument to format().

.. code-block:: javascript

    function foo(int arg1, bool arg2) public {
        print("foo entry arg1:{} arg2:{}".format(arg1, arg2));
    }

Assuming `arg1` is 5355 and `arg2` is true, the output to the log will be ``foo entry arg1:5355 arg2:true``.

The types accepted by format are ``bool``, ``uint``, ``int`` (any size, e.g. ``int128`` or ``uint64``), ``address``,
``bytes`` (fixed and dynamic), and ``string``. Enums are also supported, but will print the ordinal value
of the enum. The ``uint`` and ``int`` types can have a format specifier. This allows you to convert to
hexadecimal ``{:x}`` or binary ``{:b}``, rather than decimals. No other types
have a format specifier. To include a literal ``{`` or ``}``, replace it with ``{{`` or ``}}``.


.. code-block:: javascript

    function foo(int arg1, uint arg2) public {
        // print arg1 in hex, and arg2 in binary
        print("foo entry {{arg1:{:x},arg2:{:b}}}".format(arg1, arg2));
    }

Assuming `arg1` is 512 and `arg2` is 196, the output to the log will be ``foo entry {arg1:0x200,arg2:0b11000100}``.

.. warning::

    Each time you call the ``format()`` some specialized code is generated, to format the string at
    runtime. This requires loops and so on to do the conversion.

    When formatting integers in to decimals, types larger than 64 bits require expensive division.
    Be mindful this will increase the gas cost. Larger values will incur a higher gas cost.
    Alternatively, use a hexadecimal ``{:x}`` format specifier to reduce the cost.

.. _tags:

Tags
----

Any contract, interface, library, event definition, struct definition, function, or contract variable
may have tags associated with them. These are used for generating documentation for the contracts,
when Solang is run with the ``--doc`` command line option. This option generates some html which
lists all the types, contracts, functions, and state variables along with their tags.

The tags use a special comment format. They can either be specified in block comments or single
line comments.

.. code-block:: javascript

    /**
     * @title Hello, World!
     * @notice Just an example.
     * @author Sean Young <sean@mess.org>
     */
    contract c {
        /// @param name The name which will be greeted
        function say_hello(string name) {
            print("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }
    }

The tags which are allowed:

``@title``
    Headline for this unit

``@notice``
    General body for explaining what this unit does

``@dev``
    Any development notes

``@author``
    Field for the author of this code

``@param`` `name`
    Document a function parameter, field of struct or event. Requires a name of the field or parameter

``@return`` `name`
    Document a function return value. Requires a name of the field or parameter if the function returns
    more than one value.
