Interfaces and libraries
========================

Interfaces
__________

An interface is a contract sugar type with restrictions. This type cannot be instantiated; it can only define the
functions prototypes for a contract. This is useful as a generic interface.

.. include:: ../examples/substrate/interface.sol
  :code: solidity

- Interfaces can only have other interfaces as a base contract
- All functions must the ``external`` visibilty
- No constructor can be declared
- No contract storage variables can exist (however constants are allowed)
- No function can have a body or implementation

Libraries
_________

Libraries are a special type of contract which can be reused in multiple contracts. Functions declared in a library can
be called with the ``library.function()`` syntax. When the library has been imported or declared, any contract
can use its functions simply by using its name.

.. include:: ../examples/library.sol
  :code: solidity

When writing libraries there are restrictions compared to contracts:

- A library cannot have constructors, fallback or receive function
- A library cannot have base contracts
- A library cannot be a base contract
- A library cannot have virtual or override functions
- A library cannot have payable functions

.. note::

    When using the Ethereum Foundation Solidity compiler, libraries are a special contract type and are
    called using `delegatecall`. Solang statically links the library calls into your contract code.
    This generates larger contract code, however it reduces the call overhead and make it possible to do
    compiler optimizations across library and contract code.

Library Using For
_________________

Libraries can be used as method calls on variables. The type of the variable needs to be bound to the
library, and the type of the first parameter of the function of the library must match the type of a
variable.

.. include:: ../examples/library_using_for.sol
  :code: solidity

The syntax ``using`` `library` ``for`` `Type` ``;`` is the syntax that binds the library to the type. This
must be specified on the contract. This binds library ``lib`` to any variable with type ``int32[100]``.
As a result of this, any method call on a variable of type ``int32[100]`` will be matched to library ``lib``.

For the call to match, the first argument of the function must match the variable; note that here, `bar`
is of type ``storage``, since all contract variables are implicitly ``storage``.

There is an alternative syntax ``using`` `library` ``for *;`` which binds the library functions to any
variable that will match according to these rules.
