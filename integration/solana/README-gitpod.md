# Hello world on Solana (Gitpod version)

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
to build, deploy, and interact with programs on the Solana blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain hello world program
* A client that can send a "hello" to an account and get back the number of times "hello" has been sent

## Quick Start

Using this example in Gitpod connects to the public Solana `devnet` cluster.  Gitpod does not support Docker so running a local cluster is not supported.  Use the environment variable `CLUSTER` to choose a different Solana cluster.

Run the client to load and interact with the on-chain program:
```bash
$ npm run start
```

The remaining sections of this document point back to the non-Gitpod version of the README for more information.  Just remember, using Docker or running a local cluster is not supported if you are using Gitpod.
