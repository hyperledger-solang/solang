# Change Log

All notable changes to the "solang" extension will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- The same version of solang should be used by the language server as on the command line,
  so first look in the $PATH for solang before downloading the solang binary. As a result, the
  `forceSolangExecutable` option is no longer needed. [seanyoung](https://github.com/seanyoung)
- Go to definition, go to type definition, go to implementation is implemented. [chioni16](https://github.com/chioni16)
