# Solang Solidity Compiler

The Solang Solidity Compiler compiles Solidity for the following blockchains:

- Parity Substrate
- Solana
- evm (enough for the extension)

This extension provides syntax highlighting, diagnostics  (i.e. compiler warnings and errors), and information on types and functions when hovering.

Both the Visual Studio Code extension code and language server were developed under a
[Hyperledger Mentorship programme](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Create+a+new+Solidity+Language+Server+%28SLS%29+using+Solang+Compiler).

For more information on Solang itself and the extension, please go to the [documentation](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Dependencies

The solang compiler executable needs to be installed, which can be downloaded from
the [Solang Releases Page](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang/releases). Then
you have to configure the path to the solang executable extension settings, and also
which target you wish to compile file.

Please see the [extension documentation](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension.html).
